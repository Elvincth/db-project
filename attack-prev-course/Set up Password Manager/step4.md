### **Step 2: Open Bitwarden**
#### As the password generated by WordPress is complex which makes us hard to remember, It is better to have a password manager such as Bitwarden to manage the password and username Bitwarden is an open-source password manager which can help users to store and manage their passwords. To use Bitwarden, you need to access the following website and create an account:
#### https://vault.bitwarden.com/

<br></br>
### **Step 3: Save the Password in Bitwarden**
#### After you created an account, you need to press the `Add item` button. After that, a form will pop up and you need to input the username, the password generated by WordPress and the website URL into the form and click the `Save` button.
