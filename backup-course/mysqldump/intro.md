In this course, you will learn how to use Mysqldump for backing up data. Also, you will learn how to use OpenSSL for encrypting or decrypting WordPress data.

What is Mysqldump:
<br>
`Mysqldump`, a client program, produces logical backups by generating a set of SQL statements that may be used to rebuild the database object definitions and table contents. One or more MySQL databases are backed up or transferred to another SQL server.

Whis is OpenSSL Encryption:
<br>
As a symmetric-key encryption algorithm, `OpenSSL Encryption` will use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). For changing a long random number that people cannot easily recall, we can employ cryptographic keys of either 128bit or 256bit length. The backup file can be protected by encryption, making the backup procedure more safe.
