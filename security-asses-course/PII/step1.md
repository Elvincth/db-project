### What is Personally identifiable information (PII) 

</br>
Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can identify an individual when used alone or with other relevant data. PII may contain direct identifiers like passport information that can identify a person uniquely or quasi-identifiers like the race that can be combined with other quasi-identifiers like the date of birth to recognise an individual successfully. Personally identifiable information (PII) can be classified as sensitive or non-sensitive

Example of Personally identifiable information (PII)
​​
- Full name
- Driver’s license
- Mailing address
- Credit card information
- Passport information
- Financial information
- Medical records


Non-sensitive or indirect PII is easily accessible from public sources like phonebooks, the Internet, and corporate directories. Examples of non-sensitive or indirect PII include:

- Zipcode
- Race
- Gender
- Date of birth
- Place of birth
- Religion
