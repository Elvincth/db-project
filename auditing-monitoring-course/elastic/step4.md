### What is brute force attack?

A brute force attack, also known as exhaustive search, is a cryptographic hack that relies on guessing possible combinations of the target password until the correct one is found. The longer the password, the more combinations need to be tested. Brute force attacks can be time consuming and difficult, and sometimes impossible, to perform if methods such as data obfuscation are used. However, if the password is weak, it may take only a few seconds and require almost no effort. For an attacker, weak passwords are like shooting fish in a barrel, which is why all organizations should enforce strong password policies across all users and systems.
